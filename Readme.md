# FanCtl WebUI over USB version

The end goal of this project is to re-implement the features of my custom-loop-fanctl repo on Embassy, and also try to implement configuration and monitoring of that via a local web-based UI. First though, this is going to be a scratch space for hacking out the webserver part of it, and basic embassy runtime.
